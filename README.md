# symlc

The python package sympy can be readily used to automatically carry out lengthy but straightforward (and even most of the harder) symbolic computations. `symlc` is a wrapper module that takes strings for the ODEs and makes symbolic computations accessible from there. As of now it specializes in computing slow manifolds. Exemplary usage can be found in [examples](examples/example_notebook.ipynb).
